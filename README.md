# PlaylistPros
This Project's goal is to showcase what we have learned through Drake University's Computer Science Curriculum. We are creating a tool using the Spotify API that would allow users to essentially request songs at an event and whoever is in control of the music can approve or deny a request as well as set up parameters for it.
